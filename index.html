          My name is Oscar Gonzalez. I was born in Arlinghton Heights, IL on
          June 20, 1994. When I was 3 years old I moved to Mexico for my
          father's work. When I was 9 years old we moved back to Illinois and
          have been living here ever since. I am fluent in both English and
          Spanish. My first language is Spanish so I have a slight accent that
          makes some English words very hard to pronounce.

          I love to cook, play video games, watch movies, listen to music and
          drive my truck. I love telling jokes and making poeple laugh. After a
          few years in an industry that I love (cooking), I decided it was time
          for a change and enrolled in Northwestern University's Coding
          BootCamp. I am really enjoy coding and the endless possibilities of
          content I can create with it. I am always looking for a good challenge
          to test my skills.
