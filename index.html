          My name is Oscar Gonzalez, I was born in Arlinghton Heights IL, on
          June 20 1994. When I was 3 years old I moved to Mexico for my fathers
          work. When I was 9 years old we moved back to Illinois and have been
          living here ever since. I am fluent in both English and Spanish, my
          first language is Spanish so I do have a small accent that makes some
          English words very hard to pronounce.

          I love to cook, play video games, watching movies listening to music
          and driving my truck. I love telling jokes and making poeple laugh.
          After a few years in an industry that i love (Cooking) I decided it
          was time for a change and enrolled in the NorthWestern Coading
          BootCamp. I am really enjoy coading and the endless possibilities of
          content i can create with it. I am always looking for a good challenge
          to test my skills.
